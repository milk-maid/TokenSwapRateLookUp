# Sample Hardhat Project

The project `A Token Swap Exchange Rate LooK Up Smart Contract` where I implemented an Exchange rate look up with the help of `CHAIN LINK Oracle` during my study in the *Web3 CohortVIII* on becoming a SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPER at [**WEB3BRIDGE**](https://web3bridge.com) ::: *TRANSITIONING INTO INTO WEB3 `Love! Peace! & Web3`*

## Technologies

* SOLIDITY **.sol** : that hold the code base
* README: the markdown file attached to the root of the repo.

## Files

All the following files are programme written during the task solution
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `deploy.ts` | the script file |
| `.sol` | the generator file |
| `README.md` | the markdown file added to the root of the repository |

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
